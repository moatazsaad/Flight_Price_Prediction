                              Flight Price Detection EDA and Regression Project

1- Overview

- Developed a machine learning model to predict flight prices using regression techniques. Explored and preprocessed the dataset, identified key features, and applied various regression models.

2- Data Exploration

 - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
 - Cleaned data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and fixing inconsistencies.
 - Explored features like airline, date of journey, source, destination, flight duration, stops, and more.

3- Business Insights

- Explored business questions such as the impact of airline, routes, flight duration, stops, and departure times on flight prices.
Analyzed the distribution of flight distances, durations, and prices.

4- Data Preparation

- Engineered features such as distance categories, duration categories, and encoded categorical variables using ordinal and binary encoders.
- Applied RobustScaler to standardize numerical features.

5- Model Training

- Trained multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, KNeighbors Regressor, Support Vector Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor.
- Evaluated models using cross-validation to assess performance.

6- Model Tuning

- Fine-tuned hyperparameters for the XGBoost model using GridSearchCV.
- Despite hyperparameter tuning, the model's performance showed limited improvement.

7- Deployment

- Deployed the best-performing model (XGBoost) on Streamlit for creating an interactive data science application.
- Connected the project to Streamlit Cloud for wider accessibility.
